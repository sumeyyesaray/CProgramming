# ðŸš€ C Programming Exercises

Welcome to my C programming repository! ðŸš€ This repository documents my personal learning journey in C programming, with the goal of preparing for embedded systems development. The exercises progress from beginner to advanced, covering both basic syntax and low-level programming concepts.

>Goal: Build a strong foundation in C to develop reliable, memory-efficient embedded software.


Feel free to explore the repository and contribute by adding new examples, notes, or improving documentation.
ðŸš€ Happy Coding! ðŸŽ¯
